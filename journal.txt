GDB stub
 - Kitten: A high performance computing (HPC) OS targeted to supercomputers
 - Palacios: Embeddable Type I VMM for kitten
 - GDB Remote Serial Protocol (RSP) defines minimal set of commands that any GDB stub should implement
 - All GDB commands are mapped into RSP commands, which are sent to the GDB stub
 - GDB stub is in charge of stopping/continuing execution, memory/register examination, etc.
 - GDB implements breakpoints by changing instruction to INT3 which triggers bp exception
 - TRAP flag is used to implement single stepping - executes one instruction and stops

- GDB in normal mode is quite different than gdb using gdbstub
- In one case, gdbstub is responsible for getting debuggee info, in the other, debuggee's info is gathered using ptrace
Ptrace
 - A syscall which allows one process to access low-level info about another
 - Debugger can:
   1) r/w debuggee's memory
   2) r/w debuggee's CPU registers
   3) Notified of system events
   4) Control execution
   5) Alter its signal handling
